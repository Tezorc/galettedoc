"If you are comfortable with CSS stylesheets, you can adapt Galette CSS to "

"It is possible if needed to customize translated strings in Galette - "
"without editing any Galette source file. Just create a "
"``galette_{mylang}_local_lang.php`` file (where `{mylang}` must be replaced "
"with the language, like `fr_FR.utf8` or `en_US`) in the ``lang`` directory. "

"`Mot de passe :` and we want to replace it with `Secret :`; so we will "

"Since Galette uses a cache system for translations, changes may not be "
